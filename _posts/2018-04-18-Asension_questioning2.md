Why do I feel bad for people that are pitiful ?
Because I want to give them love, to help living creatures, to resonate with the universe.


Why am I rather negative when I hear someone being , seeming to be,better that me, even succesful?
Because I fear the competition to survive.

You are very sensitive to frequency, vibrations
Train and develop that skill.

Having the logical demon of the mind is the fact that I'm not enough trained and initiated to know what my individual thoughts are and what they are not.
It's because I was always kind of raped intellectually and spiritually.
I have to heal that.

I think there should be indeed a mind and a soul --
Because the mind is very linguistic, and trust logics, and the soul is probably Light.
2 things different I think.


What makes the difference between me and the average logical guy, said to be smart?
The reliance on the mind, and my approach to explore new mind possibilities.
What makes me hesitant and not using the present matrix?
I think it is the fact that I know it is going to change radically , so isn't it better to prepare for the change instead of using the present matrix as if it will stand still ?
