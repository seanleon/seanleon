title: Wealthy and Grounded
---

Perhaps if you could write down and apply every value you would want if you had a new life,
you might be completely grounded and aligned.

I deserve my own complete personal life, without a sosie that can do actions instead of me.

Correcting, modifying, canceling because you think it is not enough good or because you want to please, should not be done --
You should correct, modify, or cancel only if the thing needs really to be corrected for legal or communication matters --
That is, you must only correct because your higher self tells you so, not because somebody controls you and wants you to be a slave.

You used to keep your emotions for yourself, to keep your humility, thinking they were not worth being shared --
That's a misconception  due to your negative imprints --
Every emotion of yours is worth it.

Treating well others is treating well yourself, because you need to consider others as if they were you if you need to know smoothly how to deal with them, interact with them, communicate with them.

Thinking not about myself, but about the future of my family enables me to be grounded I think.

You deserve to build, construct a wealthy rich healthy life.
And this is done with a family, values and financial wealth.
There's nothing bad or dirty in trying to construct assets.
You need to be wealthy to eat well and healthy, heal your body when it is tired, change environment , make your family experience new experiences.
Money is made to enjoy life, earn time and be grounded.

Focus and think about the future and your family, not the past.
This way, you dont have blues feeling since you ground yourself on Earth
