title: Release of self-restrictive energies
---

I am realizing I am delegating too much too much to my wife and has taken my freedom, sparking possibly my epilepsy...
I have to reclaim my freedom of the past.

If you restrain yourself from your free-will actions, even a little, you wont be directly talking with God sincerely.


One way to measure your degree of freedom is your degree of freedom handling and dealing with words, 
because to handle words freely you must be able to attach your own vision to words, 
and free word handling enables free world handling

You don't have to,  like imprinted in the past, be ashamed of your plain success, 
plain personalization, plain what not.
Just do it plainly for you

You can now live freely without asking for permission from people like your wife or brother.

Release is another great keyword.
Epilepsy is about blocking energy and not releasing it
And then the body tries to release it one way or another with seizures.
As long as you are releasing your energy, physical/mental/spiritual energy you won't have epilepsy

Be free linguistically
Be free energetically

The soul is free and infinite.
But perhaps restricted in the body, by the body. Within its environment...


I used also to refrain myself from expressing my personality and my personal will 
and my personal self-interest fearing that my brother might be unhappy, or break our relationship--
That's not the case.
