title: Epilepsy is a bliss (2)
---

Humans are living beings to which you should not have any scrupule.
How to feel free and unlimited?
Perhaps with my epilepsy I will reach that state.

As long as you pay (give money for a service), you should have no fear, no shame, no guiltiness.

To eat is very important because it is aligned with self forgiveness.

The less you limit yourself in your daily life, the more free you are going to be

Have no scrupule as for asking any question to people.

Be pleased, happy and blissed to talk to people, to have fun all the time.

Life is a matter of balance.
Balance between work, money, giving back, kids, wife, leisure...

Epileptic auras prove that our perception are illusions and these illusions depend on our incarnation

Dont be afraid of expressing yourself, expressing your will and love.
We are meant to do that.

Dont repeat the same action excepting the same result.
This is insane and unhealthy.

I think epilepsy is the signal from your body that you have to enjoy life, 
ie live life without absolutely no stress nor pressure ever!
Just enjoy life.

Have constantly dreams,

Always think about positive things.
You are here on earth for that

Avoid to be kind excessively.
That makes you the potential victim of manipulation

You should stop restricting your behavior because it limits your life and gives you epilepsy

Entrepreneurship is about working a lot on innovation and capitalizing on that innovation 
by producing and solidifying a good added value

Epilepsy enables me to improve myself, learn lessons, be more disciplined and grow.
