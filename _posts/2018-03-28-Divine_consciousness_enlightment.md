title: Divine consciousness enlightment
---

Objects and features within the world you perceive, you are conscious of, are actually true real objects.
Individual consciousness is a fractal representation of the divine creator.
We are all an individual experience of God, aiming at evolving and ascending
Consciousness is divine and everything.

I realize that I was wrong and limited in my vision of Nature and the Universe, 
which made me think and see the wrong or limited way.
I am very excited to be taught about the ascended/matured viewpoint.

I also have the feeling that I am going to use crypto money to earn time and 
learn ever more about the evolved metaphysics and ensure health/wealth/love/positivity to my family.

Why does a plant want to communicate more than a stone? for example
They are all both living creatures, but the plant is more evolved to share its feelings in resonance with the divine plan.

I used to see people from the point of view of my past values (traumas, childhood values, chakras not really balanced)
It's time to see see people and everything else from the point of view of evolved creature (love, harmony, positivity)


With love, you know how to make it by divine inspiration and end up being succesful, so send and envision love all the time.
