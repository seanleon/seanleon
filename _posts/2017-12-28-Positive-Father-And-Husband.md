What is the difference between mature and immature ppl?
There are many but one of them is that unlike immature ppl , mature ppl know, feel and understand that you get and have what you are, 
and that yes you learn lessons by failing and dealing with ppl that can criticize you or not behave always like you want, 
and that you should not lose your time generating an anti-reaction that is negative, 
because then you will just stay in the negativity.
Lessons are learnt by positivizing the negativity.
That is, when you are trying a new thing, a new thought to somebody and that person is negative, 
you should not be shocked or discouraged.
Just ignore and try to somebody else.
Just dont deal with that person and look for another one.
That is why it takes time to look for ppl, and important to look for partners, the right mature ones.


I used to be embittered, negative about actions or initiatives from others
I have now understood my lesson.
It is about appreciating actions from others and building.

My wife can be negative and temperamental.
She teaches me how not to respond to negativity.

To love yourself and others to receive love from them so that they like and appreciate what you do.
Humans are either positive or negative.
Ignore negativity absolutely even if it is your kids that are being negative.

Yes, you must give to receive.
But if the person does not give back, should you be negative?
No if you are grown up.

At the end of the day, what do you target with your wife? The end of the road?
You have to indeed decide.
I think she already knows what she wants.
I have to grow up and decide myself for myself too.
The main and biggest issue is your kids.
You might be indeed here to protect them and ensure that they grow up well.
But what and how to educate them as a father.
