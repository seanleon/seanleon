Be sensitive.
That's key to success and happiness.
Sensitive to one's physical world
Sensitive to one's desire
Then you can lead yourself so that you can achieve your dreams

 
Freedom and sensitiveness towards one's desire, energy and physical world and words.

To be free and sensitive linguistically and energetically also means to be sincere and honest with the self.

The more free and sensitive energetically and linguistically you are, the more healthy and wealthy you will be because you match your desires on Earth a richer way

Words can be amazing.
Because when you uncover their meaning you can discover some great truths and wisdom of Humanity

Why do I like to reduce things to one simple often simplistic scheme?
That is probably a defense reaction mirroring my parents behavior.

Of course everybody is limited and biased by his own limited vision but I should detach myself from this simplified view and make it more complex.
It comes also from the fact that I often was the target of insults in my childhood and I had to put people in simple categories.

Words are energy that can bring you new concepts .
Be open to new words in general.

In any case you should not talk or speak negative stuff or news
And you should not be approximative in your speaking
