title: Epilepsy is a bliss 
---

Epilepsy is a negative feedback loop against you
that wants you to respond to it and modify your stance vs Life.

After several epilepsies, I feel more free to communicate with people and attend events.
It is because I am communicating with my higher self.

I can avoid any stress and psychotic feeling.
I think I can prevent them by communicating with my auras and telling them to stop.

I am psychic and my auras are here to tell me to let my psychism express itself, freely.

I should have a strong set of rules to live, to reach ascended and mature people stance to Life.

What kind of people should I be with?
Express your talent, that's the only thing you should do.
Life only expects you to do that.

Thanks to your epilepsy, you realize what Life is.
Life should be enjoyed and free.

You should not have any limit. Literally speaking.

Epilepsy enables you to realize that you should not have any scrupule.

You should not have any scrupule as for asking questions.

Because of your epilepsy you can now eliminate your scrupules and have no pressure and enjoy life 100%.

Many things make you think/feel different right now after your epilepsy.

Why are you born half JP-FR?
To care for ascension and growth.
Perhaps that's your single most important feature, so that you can be compatible with ETs and Aliens.
That might be the thing for which you live.
What is life?

Fatigue is a form of epilepsy.
Epilepsy is a form of fatigue.

Epilepsy will probably make you communicate much more with your higher self.
You are having an epilepsy for that reason too.

Thank you epilepsy!
