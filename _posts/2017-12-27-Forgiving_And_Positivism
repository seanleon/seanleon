title: Forgiving & Positivism
---


Much of my seizure issues come from the negative childhood I had , due to the negative education I received from my parents.
Yes you received a bad education.
But like my brother says, they at least taught you what you should not do and repeat to yourself and others.
See the good in your bad education and forgive.
Apply the wisdom earned for your life by taking the lessons.

Dont be resentful and teach all the good values to your kids
Be more mature than so far, by stopping having hatred.
You have chosen your parents and you are half responsible of your situation and choice.
Recognize their good values and forget and ignore the rest.
Focus every instant on love, future and free will.

Those that are materially and spiritually wealthy and healthy, mostly probably did their job in their past lifes 
or current lifes, to be so in their current life.
This is an awesome rule.

This time in 2017/2018, many ppl will get rich with cryptos and mostly probably 
they deserve it some way or another, or rather they of course deserve it because of the law of karma.

Yes, you have been particularly sensitive to the negative imprints you received from you education and of course 
you repeated the memes you were imprinted --- negativity and  anti-humanity
But without accepting it in your body.
Now you understand you have to repeat positivism and love as memes.
