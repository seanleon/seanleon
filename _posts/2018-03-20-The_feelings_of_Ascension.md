title: The feelings of Ascension
---

You should not express anger and negativity -- hold your anger, negativity, illbeing for yourself.
It is essential that you care in a subtle way about you, Sean and Leon, your family --
At every instant, you should feel only joy, happiness, love, bliss, well being.

The universe is subtle, positive, mature.
God and other higher beings like the angels have probably made this beautiful and subtle world.

Now is the time.
I have the feeling that I am in a new world with another perspective. A perspective much bigger, exciting and positive.

It s a bliss to receive a thought form, a feeling, an image. 
It s a bliss to be able to use one's mind and spirit to communicate all sort of images, thoughts and feelings.

The law of one.
We are all connected.
So when you have a thought form, you must accept it and cohere it with your reality.

You are one with the universe and each time you receive a feeling, a thought, 
a vision from your mind which is the mirror of the universe, it's a bliss

Yes, it's as though I've changed my way of thinking.
Is it ascension?
I feel less materialistic but more etheric.
This is very interesting
