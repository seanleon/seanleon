title: Doing The Opposite Of Negative Imprints
---



Again to receive you must give.
In order to have and get, you must be.

Because of the law of fractal holographic reflexivity.
Because human individuals are quantum communicators.
But sometimes some individuals dont know this law and ignore it.
For these individuals, you must ignore them and try to keep on pursuing your personal goals.

Why did I again badly treat Atsuko (my wife), Sean and Leon.
Because my imprints must have been very serious and you still receive their bad influence.

This is not acceptable that I mistreat  my children -- my goal is to teach them love.

If you mistreat, swear onto Atsuko and Sean and Leon, 
it means indeed you still have not understood the rule of learning lessons by doing the opposite of what you received as bad imprints.
So you did it again.
I must apologize towards them

Maybe it is ok to give love without receiving love because that might be the way to heal my trauma and karma?

You should never ever imprint on your kids the negativity you received in your past.
Same thing towards your wife.
Your family life is being an opportunity to do the opposite.

Just respond neutrally and be fine with Sean Leon Atsuko actions, thoughts and words, to go beyond your negative imprints.
Go beyond your need to defend yourself.

According to Kate O'Connell, meditation is just being the Observer of your Experience.
I agree.
I was exactly thinking and questioning that today.
How to respond to the negativity from others and I got the answer.

When I tell the rude words that I received in my childhood to Atsuko,
I am just repeating my imprints as a defense.
This is the biggest mistake I can do.
Go beyond that by being neutral.

Sean and Leon are the most beautiful entities that I have made.
