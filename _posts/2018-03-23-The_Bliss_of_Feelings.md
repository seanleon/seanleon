title: The Bliss of Feeling(s)
---

Feeling love is differrent than being neutral.
To have, to get and receive a certain feeling (and all feelings are differrent and unique) 
you have to get the universe be in a unique certain configuration.
That's why you can create objects for example with consciousness. 
Because you co-create with the universe and you need to set it in a certain configuration, situation.

When you have a feeling, a thought form, 
it's a bliss because it's an opportunity to realize you actually co-create with the universe.

It's also a bliss to write down what comes to you.
It's so beautiful.

Using many tools, you can certainly remove negativity and blockage on condition probably that:
- you know how subtly an action, mattter, energy vibration influences a person, at the smallest level
- you know how to read in a person mind and life.

Coffee which amplifies energy could have been needed by humans up until now to try 
to compensate for a sensation of lack or block that they feel.
Just like when I tried some drug (natural or pharmaceuticals)  to enhance my sensibility

Ultimately it's not about searching and copypasting but receiving in/by all your feeling capacity.

Ultimately you must be very sensitive in your feelings. 
and care about your reactions to an action from the universe to learn how to act back on the universe 
with your feelings and thought forms.
