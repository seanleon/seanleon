title: Do what you feel
---

You might have your epilepsy because your sacral and solar plexus were unbalanced.
You can see it in your timidity and the fact that you block your honest will and opinion.

Balance your chakras out.

Trust your feelings ultimately as ultimately your feelings are going to create your reality.

I have realized recently I have less negative pressure on my 2nd or 3rd chakra --
Because I do more what I feel.

Yes do just what you feel.
And the new paradigm is going to help you a lot on that.

Discuss, talk with your feelings.
Don't convince your feelings.
Be convinced by your feelings.

Feelings are always right.
They come from the omniscient higher self.

You will find an explanation of why you felt this way with 3d elements and that becomes then wisdom for other earthly beings.

3d Explanation of 4d feelings is wisdom considered on Earth as valuable.
