title: Healing the 5th Chakra (throat chakra) and the power of words
---

Because of humility, fear of not being loved, you might defend yourself by putting forth that you are a victim.
You are not a victim, you can change that and you are winner, with your fengshui items and mentors


Like balanced people, you should think the world is just yours, created by yourself.
Why should you be hesitating to use it?
Even people that disturb you, obstacles, negative people are your creations in the movie you are making.

Words are detailed different specific energies.
In the past I had to mix them up because I was not authorized to differentiate them.
My own personal sensibility was destroyed to please systematically traumatizers.
Now I have all the freedom to express my feelings for each word.

What does it mean to be sensible to words?
How to be sensible to words?
That might be one the most important things

Trust that this world is yours
The world is not external to you, it is internal to you.
People are not external to you, they are internal to you

I know and use many words and phrases of mine everyday.
And it has become my basic vocabulary.
Now why not enriching this vocabulary everyday so that new words and new phrases, become part of my life?
It's easy, just be curious and accept them as part of your life by questioning their meaning

You can do whatever you say, on anything --
That is you can dare to attach meaning and sense on anything, with words creating your own world --
That is one of the things you should understand with the power of words

To be free with Life, is to be free with words --
If you are free with words, you'll be free with Life
In your childhood, you have been traumatized and blocked in your words usage and expression --
You have to heal and correct that
