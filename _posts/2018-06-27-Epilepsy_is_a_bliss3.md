title: Epilepsy is a bliss (3)
---

You have had too much shame about yourself and anxiety stuck in your belly -- this has triggered epilepsy.

Epilepsy is a way for your body to manifest your body and your spirit
that you cant stand anymore your stress and that you want to ascend from that.
Awesome.

I was trained and educated to think I was not worth much.
What is it for?
To be able to learn forgiveness and ascend?

Epilepsy enables you to be much more free in your life.

When you have epilepsy you have less restriction on yourself.
Epilepsy enables you to learn how to be free.

ã€€
After all, you do things because you channel them -- not because you carefully think about them before acting....
You just do them on the fly.

The trick is to free yourself by yourself for yourself.
As we experience experiences, we get modified and evolve.

Talk, express yourself only if you want to express yourself, and not because you are forced.
Talking naturally with others is like talking with one's world.

When you have your epilepspy, or your symptoms, it means you should get rid of your shame and express what you are, that's it.
Just express what you are.

I am asked by my epilepsy to be more liberal, loving, free, enjoying.
Enjoy life.

Epilepsy is occuring in order for you to forget your former character and life, to have a new life.

I have enough to be badly treated, to treat myself badly.

Having wealth and probably health is just the result of just allowing yourself these.
You should probably everyday remind yourself of the freedom you have and how much you should enjoy life everyday.

You are having epilepsy to be more free.
What is life for?
What is economy for?
I thought it was for exploiting people and enslaving others. I was practically wrong.
It's for ascending and growing.
Enjoying people and their love.
Growing.
Learning lessons by enjoying just life.
That s the only thing to do.
You just have to change your point of view
That's it.
You progress in life in order for you to change your point of view.


Epilepsy is also a symptom , a sign to listen much more to your body, to be more sensitive to it.
So be it.
Epilepsy really enables to generate and apply new rules for life to be healthy and wealthy.
This is absolutely genius.
Epilepsy enables such generation because it puts your soul spirit mind body into a a different point of view literally.

I am realizing people around me people that I deal with are not of Jesus or Buddha level,
but work first for themselves and that's what youd should do, work for yourself first.
You are here on earth to enjoy life.

In order to know how to give back to others, and be in service for others, you got to know how to treat yourself well.

Perhaps people when they will get to know ascension and disclosure will have epilepsy.
