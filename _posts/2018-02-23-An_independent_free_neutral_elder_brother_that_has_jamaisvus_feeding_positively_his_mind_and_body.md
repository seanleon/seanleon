title: An Independent Free Neutral Elder Brother that has Jamaisvus Feeding Positively his Mind and Body
---

You love this notion of imprint and that's one of your goal to master the dissolution of bad imprints and generation of good ones to ensure a happy fulfilled life to your family.
But how to do that if you are not happy and loved in your life?

Indeed really one of my main issues is how to deal with karma and negativity.
That's probably one of my main missions here on Earth to solve successfully that problem, 
given the circumstances, environment, and situation in which I was born.

What is it that you should not do about mistakes?
Not repeat them.

Because opportunities are ad infinitum.
And next time you have the/an opportunity, you just have not to repeat the same mistake.

We  are immortal, eternal and Life in this sense is eternal --
Crisis, traumas, accidents, give you the opportunity to transcend yourself and alter for the better your consciousness to perceive Life differently, more maturely --

Your kids, Sean and Leon, are not children in the sense that given their past life, they are probably more senior than you and can teach you many lessons.
So embrace you newly found consciousness as elder brother to enjoy life and experience jamaisvus.

People, be it parents or school or society did not encourage me to generate positive personal jamaisvus, 
whereas my will was to generate such jamaisvus.
That's why I turned to negative dejasvus defensively, with the side effects of imprinting.
But now I understand I have to heal that and just do positive personal jamaisvus.

I like to describe myself as: 
Independent free neutral elder brother that has positive jamaisvus feeding positively his mind and body.

Now that you allow yourself to be a newborn by being free independent neutral feeding yourself positively with jamaisvus,
your thoughts and insights are much more insightful and mature. GREAT.

Memento Audere Semper (Remember to always dare)!
