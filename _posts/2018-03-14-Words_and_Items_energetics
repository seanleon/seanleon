title: Words and Items energetics 
---

I love objects of good fengshui and words.
Storing them might be a way for me to reach the astral plane.
I am passionate about that.

Words (Kotaba in Japanese, which means literally that which carries objects) are objects in the sense that they charge our ether and universe with fengshui.
You imprint and program your life with words, and fengshui that load positively your life.
Fengshui objects load words and are loaded by words.

Books, with the advent of publishing have been extraordinary. 
They have given us access to infinite knowledge.
But do we know how to make use of that treasure completely?

My way is to absorb books and words by resonating with them, 
co vibrating with them and focusing on what I dont know and seems a bit difficult.
Approach what seems a bit hard for me and new, and find a way to co-vibrate with it.
