title: Ascension questioning

You are in an era, time where now you do, say, act because you feel, accordingly.
This is about a new dimension, the etheric world that is linked and connected with the physical world and
influence it positively.

I used not to be able to think by myself.
I used to just copy paste or repeat.
Now I am in a time where I have understood that your feelings are a holographic projection on the universe,
a programming, a cast.
But not in a small way, in a big way.
Just like a fractal ripple on a pound.
You are being influenced by every atom, and you influence anything else.
I thank my childhood, epilepsy, marriage and my life to reach that understanding.

I will be able to be on my own, to act on my own when I can decide on my "feelings"

As for feelings, do we have to act directly upon them or think twice rationally as they say?

I think it would help to study what happened in Atlantis.
I feel suddenly very drawn to them.

For now it's like I am in an ethereal state while being grounded.
But the main issue is Sean and Leon.
What should I do with them?
Why did they choose me?

The natural way of operating with Nature, the Universe, is to communicate with her, it and co vibrate with them.
Things that go counter to them must be indeed programmed by a consciousness that is self-fish.

With your feelings, visions, thought forms, 
it's a bliss to have,receive, generate them within the universe 
and the first thing to do probably is to systematically acknowledge them when they come up.

As for white magic,
to begin programing the universe, you must feel, say, view, resonate with your words 
and act upon them.
But do not throw words without attaching value to them.

The observer is the creator.
In that sense you have to value and care for whatever you observe, because this is what you create.

You chose Atsuko not as a wife, but more like a sister.
This would explain why you call yourself an elder brother from the beginning.
You might be a brother for Sean and Leon and you are here to ascend with them.
