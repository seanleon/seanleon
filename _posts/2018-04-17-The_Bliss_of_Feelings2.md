The Bliss of Feelings (2)

To feel and to create , to feel what you create is a bliss --
Executing effectively in 3d what you see in 4d helps you value what you see in your internal ether,
otherwise you might consider it just the product of your imagination, neglecting it.
You have to converse with your soul and remind you that's the authority .

Yes, it's about now going back to full alignment -- 
alignment for example between the words you utter, your feelings and what you do.

You still have some negativity-impregnated statements when you are greedy, self-oriented or profit-oriented.
That comes from the fear of competition.
But when you feel blessed to live because you know how healthy Life is extraordinary , 
you just want to share that happiness and that is all that matters.

Uttering internally with one's mind and will uses energy, uses prana and creates a soul reality.

Dont throw out words that do not align, are not attuned to your feelings and vision.
Purify yourself from the non-alignment demon.

Try to think about and visualize and feel the Light pouring into Sean, Leon and your family constantly.

I think there's a difference between an internal utterance and a real sincere authentic feeling.

To to feel authentically the bliss.

When you meditate, why not reminding yourself of how beautiful your kids are with pictures, 
sincerely while feeling the love in your heart.
